**White bears and ice melting**
*05/02/19*

We all know that polar bears, or *Ursus maritimus*, are an endangered species threatened by the climate change and the ice melting. But we also know that medias tend to exagerate and to simplify a lot without taking all the informations in consideration. Let’s try to go over the true and the false !

![](ours_fonte)

How is the ice melting affect the white bears ? Actually, they only feed during the spring and they accumulate reserves to be able to live the rest on the year on a empty stomach. The fact is that with the **global warming**, the ice lasts to form in winter and melts earlier in summer. It extends the fasting period of polar bears and makes them weaker. In consequences, they produce less offspring, they are smaller and they are more likely to catch diseases.

At the same time, data from the canadian gouvernement shows us that the bear population on the Baffin island is stable and even up.
All the polar bear population is not in the same situation but the reducing number of specimen is a fact. There are always good and bad year for polar bears, but the climate change makes these bad years increase. The global warming is really the principal threat fot polar bears but we need to be carefull with what media try to convay. They will show you a picture of an agonizing white bear in a land where ice is missing and telling us that is the consequences of the global warming while the bear can be sick or old. Moreover the condition of one bear does not reflect the condition of all the bear population. Be carefull to develop your **criticize mind** !

So, global warming causes the destruction of the white bears habitat. What can we do ?

A lot of imaginative scientists are working on the subject. Michael Wolovick and John C. Moore are two scientists that would like to build a subsea wall of 50 to 100m high and 80 to 120km long to stop the hot stream in the bottom of the ocean. There is also the American Geophysical Union that has the project to refreeze the icecap thanks to a geoengineering technique that would rely on wind-powered pumps, in other words with millions of wind turbines.
Unfortunately, these projects request a lot of funds and do not ensure the stability needed for polar bears.

All we can do is **stop releasing gaz emissions** to slow down the global warming and reduce the ice melting, but it is not an easy thing to do. Scientists have been warning us since decades now but **the changement is slow and insufficient**, looking how fast the situation is degrading.
**Let’s hope for changement and the rehabilitation of a correct balance between the environement and human activities.**
